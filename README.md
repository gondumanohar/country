# country
To give an overview of the dataset and the steps involved in training and evaluating machine learning models, you can use the following summary:

Dataset Overview:
The dataset used for this machine learning project is a country comparison dataset that includes several features like:

Year: The year of observation.
Population (in Millions): The population of a country in millions.
Population Growth Rate (%): The annual growth rate of the population in percentage.
Unemployment Rate (%): The unemployment rate, which is the target variable that we want to predict.
The goal of the project is to classify whether the unemployment rate is above or below the median unemployment rate, turning the continuous target variable into a binary classification problem.

Machine Learning Process Overview:
In this project, we applied three different machine learning algorithms to classify the unemployment rate:

Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification.
Decision Tree Classifier: A non-linear model that splits the data based on feature thresholds.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble of decision trees that improves prediction accuracy.
Steps in the Project:
Data Preprocessing:

Feature Selection: We used three features:
Year
Population (in Millions)
Population Growth Rate (%)
Target Variable: The target variable is the Unemployment Rate (%). This continuous value was converted into a binary classification target by comparing it with the median value:
python
Copy code
threshold = y.median()
y_binary = (y >= threshold).astype(int)
Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split from sklearn.
Model Training:

Three models were trained on the dataset:
Logistic Regression: A linear classification algorithm.
Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based model that recursively splits the data.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that averages multiple decision trees to improve performance.
Model Evaluation:

The models were evaluated using several metrics:
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted observations.
Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion Matrix: Shows the breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
ROC-AUC: Evaluates how well the model distinguishes between the two classes. Higher values indicate better performance.
ROC Curve:

The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve was plotted for all three models to compare their ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is also reported for each model.
Code Summary:
The Python code performs the following tasks:

Load the dataset using pandas.
Preprocess the dataset, converting the target variable into binary classes.
Train three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC.
Plot the ROC curves for a visual comparison of model performance.
How to Run the Code:
Install Dependencies:

Future Enhancements:
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the models using techniques like grid search or random search to improve performance.
Feature Engineering: Add more relevant features to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy.
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to better assess the performance of the models.
